# 60hr Workweek Report Bot

This Google Apps Script automates your daily work report process. It:
- Copies a report-template from omniscience folder.
- Creates a daily report with name format: tue, 19 aug
- Adds this format to the workweek sheet as chip!
- Sends a message to your discord channel with webhook.

### To reproduce this:
- Take a webhook url for discord. (Edit Channel)

- Create a new project. copy/paste the script 
- Copy/paste both templates: doc template, sheet template
- Run the script
